This is a meta-analysis of how often computers encounter malware, sourced from the best data I could find.

## Methodology

This is a compilation of data I've found through years of (amateur) research into malware and cybersecurity. There were 2 major approaches:

* **Literature review** - I included all reports and published data that I accrued during my research into general cybersecurity advice for [Sensible Security](https://security.stolovitz.com/). I started this research around 2017. I searched multiple databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Google, and Bing, for terms like "malware infection rates", "malware encounter rate", "malware prevalance." I also included any data I found incidentally during this research.
* **Snowball** - I followed notable sources in the literature I found. For example, Levesque's paper *A clinical study of risk factors related to malware infections* includes refernces to the Panda Labs reports, which I had found earlier but forgotten.

I included sources only that had specific, real-world encounter rates for malware derived from actual detections. Norton, for example, publishes survey-based data (phrased like, "have you been affected by malware in the last 12 months"), and was excluded from these results.

{/*
Worth noting:

* What they are measuring (ie Kaspersky 2017: "Unique users whose computers have been targeted by Malware-class web attacks as a percentage of all unique users of certain Kaspersky Lab products in the country")
* Sample size (Kaspersky again: "We excluded those countries where the number of Kaspersky Lab product users is relatively small (less than 50,000)")
* Each group has per-country data.

## Caveats

This data is, obviously, sparse. There are few things worth noting:

* Microsoft data for the 2nd half of 2017 is estimated from a graph. No precise numbers are readily available.
* Microsoft's annual data for 2018 is average *monthly* exposure rate, not a cumulative annual number.

Data is sparse:

* Microsoft stopped reporting encounter rates after 2018. This appears to be part of a transition from the *Microsoft Security Intelligence Report* to the *Microsoft Digital Defense Report*.

* Panda Labs stopped reporting encounter rates after 1Q2016, transitioning in 1Q2017 to reporting a different metric. 2Q2017 explains (emphasis as original):

    > To calculate the figures shown below we decided not to count the detection of any malware that we’ve already detected by signatures (which would be in the hundreds of millions) [...] Nor will we include heuristic detection techniques, which are able to detect variants of known malware or techniques.
    >
    > [...]
    >
    > **We are going to take into account only new malware data that was not detected either by signatures or heuristics** — malware attacks, fileless attacks, and any attack made through the abuse of legitimate system tools, something which is increasingly common in corporate environments, as we saw in the case of GoldenEye/Petya back in June.

* A lot of data is missing:

    * Kaspersky 2015 did not seem to include annual infection rates (although the PDF was not available).
    * Microsoft's reports did not include malware statistics for the 2nd half of 2016 or 2Q2017, for no obvious reason.
    * Panda Labs did not report numbers for their 4th quarter, in general, preferring to publish an *annual* number instead.
    * Panda Labs' report for 3Q2015 is [mis-linked on their website](https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/pandalabs/pandalabs-compilation/), and was not available via Google/Bing searches or URL spelunking.

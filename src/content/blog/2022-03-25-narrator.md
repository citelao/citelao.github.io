Here's what I think about when I design for screen readers like Narrator.

* Names
  * Visible text, plus icons.
  * Nothing more---keep it simple.
* Descriptions & help text
  * Any visible labels
  * Hide the now-redundant labels from screen readers
* Landmarks, headings, and contexts
  * Landmarks for all the main sections of the page
    * Look at the typical section types.
    * Any other big groups of content? Add those.
    * F6 for landmarks!
  * Headings for any visible headings
    * Do they indicate a landmark?
  * Contexts
    * &rarr; a named group of content, read when focus enters the content.
    * Landmarks should automatically be a context.
    * Headings might indicate a context! You may need to add manually.
* Keyboarding
  * Good screen readers require good keyboarding
  * Arrow keys &rarr; posinset, sizeofset
  * Tab all the things!
  * Good default focus?
  * Access keys?
  * Hotkeys?
* The danger zone
  * Lots of custom names and descriptions
    * Why do screen reader users get that, and not visual users?
  * Changes onscreen elsewhere
    * How will users know?
  * Focus shifts
    * Button disabled upon pressing it? Where does focus go? The cancel button!?
  * Dialogs
    * Hard to do well.
    * Does it trigger dialog reading?
